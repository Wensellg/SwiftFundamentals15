/*:
 ## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */

let friends = 250
print(friends)

//: Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media.
//: Attempting to update the `friends` constant would cause an error, so that line has been removed.

/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */

print("The code does not compile if you try to change `friends` because it is a constant, and constants cannot be updated after they are set.")
